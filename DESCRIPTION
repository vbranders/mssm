Title: Sub-Matrix of Maximal Sum identification, Scala implementation wrapped in R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Vincent Branders, Pierre Schaus and Pierre Dupont
Maintainer: Vincent Branders <vincent.branders@uclouvain.be>
Description: This package provides tools for the identification of submatrix of maximal sum.
    A submatrix is a rectangular, non-necessarily contiguous, subset of rows and of columns of a (larger) matrix.
    The submatrices that are searched for are max-sum submatrices.
    A submatrix is of maximal sum if the sum of its entires (selected from the original matrix) is of maximal sum.
    This package is a wrapper for the Scala implementation originally provided.
